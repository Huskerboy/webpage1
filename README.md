# Media Page

**webpage1** is a social media/gaming website. It is currently still in development, but at the moment you can
1. Create a profile
2. Post updates
3. Follow and unfollow other users
4. View other users profiles

Will be working on adding more to the user profile page including a bio, profile picture, and list of favorite games.
In addition, I am working on bringing my Ride the Bus game to life by putting it on this website too. Am currently in the midst of
working out bugs and getting the game to work. I am using ajax to interact with the backend so that you never have to reload the page, and
will be using sessions so that I can keep track at your attempts and so that the game can remember your previous cards. I would like to 
implement a leader board as well. Stay tuned for future updates.
